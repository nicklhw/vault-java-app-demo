# Vault Java App Demo

This repo demonstrates the integration between Vault and a sample Java application using the 
[Spring Cloud Vault](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-vault/reference/html/) library. 

![](assets/vault-java-app-demo.svg)

- demo-app is a Spring Boot application that exposes a REST API.
    - The app calls the Vault agent to retrieve static KV secrets, encrypt and decrypt data using the transit secrets engine, 
      and get dynamic database credentials to connect to MySQL database.
    - The app uses the Spring Cloud Vault library to integrate with the Vault API.
- [Vault agent](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/vault-agent/agent-read-secrets) acts as a sidecar proxy here to retrieve secrets from Vault.
    - Auto-auth is used to handle the login to Vault and the renewal of the Vault auth token. Using auto-auth removes the responsibility of managing the auth token from the client application, making it easier for application to consume Vaultâ€™s API.
    - Vault agent is optional in this case since Spring Cloud Vault library has the ability to authenticate to Vault.
- On the Vault server side 3 secrets engines are enabled: database, KV, and transit
    - The database secrets engine integrates with MySQL to generate dynamic DB credentials for the demo-app
    - The transit secrets engine is used for encrypting and decrypting application data
- [Sample Postman collection](spring-vault-demo/demo.postman_collection.json) included
